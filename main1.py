        Welcome to the Seed Quality Finders!  üîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying Seed Quality efficiently. Upload an image of a Seed, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of Quality. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Find our seed quality** page and upload an image of a Seed with suspected Quality.
    2. **Quality Analysis:** Quality analysis may involve comparing the extracted features against predefined quality criteria or standards.
    3. **Feature Extraction:** CNNs are capable of learning hierarchical representations of image features, starting from low-level features like edges and textures and gradually progressing to higher-level features like shapes and objects
    4. **Classification:** Classification may involve assigning a quality score or label to each seed, such as "Average quality," "Bad quality,"  "Excellent quality," " Good quality," " Worst quality."
    5.  **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.
                

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate Quality detection.
    - **User-Friendly:**  With simple navigation and clear visualizations, you can easily interpret the results of the seed quality analysis and make informed decisions.
    - **Fast :** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.
    - **Efficiency:** Say goodbye to manual seed inspection processes that are time-consuming and prone to errors.
